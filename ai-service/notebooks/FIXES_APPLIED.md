# DKT Training Notebook - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Output Directory
**Problem:** Cell 24 tried to save output to `../output/example_stem_path.json` but the directory didn't exist.

**Solution:** Created `/Users/llow/Desktop/learnpathai/ai-service/output/` directory.

### 2. ResourceType Enum Conversion Error
**Problem:** In `stem_path_generator.py`, when loading the knowledge graph from JSON, the `Resource` dataclass expected a `ResourceType` enum but received strings.

**Solution:** Modified the `_load_knowledge_graph()` method to properly convert string types to `ResourceType` enums:
```python
if 'type' in r_copy and isinstance(r_copy['type'], str):
    r_copy['type'] = ResourceType(r_copy['type'])
```

### 3. Path Resolution Issue
**Problem:** The knowledge graph path resolution failed when running from the notebooks directory because `Path(__file__).parent.parent` didn't resolve the `..` symlinks correctly.

**Solution:** Added `.resolve()` to normalize the path:
```python
path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / "backend" / "data" / "stem_knowledge_graph.json"
```

### 4. Redundant Code in Cell 13
**Problem:** Cell 13 duplicated the DKT evaluation code from Cell 7, causing confusion and potential variable conflicts.

**Solution:** Simplified Cell 13 to just display a success message referencing the already-computed metrics.

### 5. Inefficient Mastery Lookup in Cell 21
**Problem:** Cell 21 used a complex nested list comprehension to find mastery changes, which was inefficient and hard to read.

**Solution:** Created a lookup dictionary for O(1) access:
```python
original_mastery = {node.concept.id: node.current_mastery for node in path_a.nodes}
old_mastery = original_mastery.get(node.concept.id, 0.0)
```

## Testing Results

All components were tested successfully:

✅ **Imports**: All required modules import correctly from the notebook context
✅ **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates student interaction sequences successfully
✅ **DKT Training**: Model trains and saves to disk without errors
✅ **DKT Evaluation**: Computes AUC, Brier score, and accuracy metrics
✅ **Beta-KT Baseline**: Comparison model works correctly
✅ **STEM Path Generation**: Loads 12 concepts from knowledge graph and generates personalized paths
✅ **Path Updates**: Dynamically updates paths based on new user attempts
✅ **JSON Export**: Successfully exports paths to JSON format

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/llow/Desktop/learnpathai/ai-service/stem_path_generator.py`
   - Fixed ResourceType enum conversion
   - Fixed path resolution with `.resolve()`

2. `/Users/llow/Desktop/learnpathai/ai-service/notebooks/dkt_training.ipynb`
   - Simplified Cell 13
   - Optimized Cell 21

3. **Created directories:**
   - `/Users/llow/Desktop/learnpathai/ai-service/output/`

## How to Run the Notebook

```bash
cd /Users/llow/Desktop/learnpathai/ai-service/notebooks
jupyter notebook dkt_training.ipynb
```

Or run all cells in order from top to bottom. Each cell should execute without errors.

## Next Steps

The notebook is now ready for:
- Training production DKT models
- Generating STEM learning pathways
- Comparing model performance
- Exporting paths for the API

All errors have been resolved! ✅
