## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Age Detection Flow

```typescript
// 1. User selects age group or enters age
handleAgeGroupSelect(ageGroup, age)

// 2. Store in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('userAgeGroup', ageGroup.id)
localStorage.setItem('userAge', age.toString())

// 3. Load age-appropriate content
const courses = getActiveCoursesByAgeGroup(ageGroupId)
const path = getLearningPathByAgeGroup(ageGroupId)

// 4. Apply age-specific filtering
ageAwarePathGenerator.generateLearningPath(
  userId,
  userAge,
  currentMastery,
  learningGoals,
  maturityLevel
)
```

### Content Filtering

```typescript
// Filter resources by age appropriateness
function filterResourcesByAgeGroup(ageGroup: AgeGroup): LearningResource[] {
  return resources.filter(resource =>
    resource.ageGroups.includes(ageGroup.id) &&
    validateResourceAppropriateness(resource, ageGroup)
  )
}

// Validate content meets restrictions
function validateResourceAppropriateness(
  resource: LearningResource,
  ageGroup: AgeGroup
): boolean {
  const restrictions = ageGroup.contentRestrictions
  
  // Check duration
  if (resource.estimatedDuration > restrictions.maxVideoDuration) {
    return false
  }
  
  // Check complexity
  if (resource.difficulty > restrictions.maxTextComplexity * 10) {
    return false
  }
  
  // Check interaction types
  return resource.interactionTypes.some(type =>
    restrictions.allowedInteractionTypes.includes(type)
  )
}
```

### Path Generation

```typescript
// Generate personalized learning path
public generateLearningPath(
  userId: string,
  userAge: number,
  currentMastery: Map<string, number>,
  learningGoals: string[],
  maturityLevel?: number
): LearningPath {
  // 1. Determine age group
  const ageGroup = determineAgeGroup(userAge, maturityLevel)
  
  // 2. Filter concepts
  const concepts = filterConceptsByAgeGroup(ageGroup)
  
  // 3. Order by mastery
  const orderedConcepts = orderByMastery(concepts, currentMastery)
  
  // 4. Apply age-specific pacing
  const pacedConcepts = applyDevelopmentalPacing(orderedConcepts, ageGroup)
  
  return {
    id, userId, ageGroupId, title, description,
    concepts: pacedConcepts,
    estimatedCompletion, progress, createdAt
  }
}
```
