## 🎯 Judge Questions & Answers

**Q: "How does the AI generate challenges?"**
> A: We use Google Gemini with structured prompts. The AI considers the student's skill level, learning style, and past performance. If AI is unavailable, we have template fallbacks.

**Q: "How do you prevent cheating?"**
> A: Challenges are parameterized per user, we have time-based pattern detection, and server-side validation. Rate limiting prevents XP farming.

**Q: "Is this scalable?"**
> A: Absolutely. API-first design, modular components, and we can add Redis for leaderboard caching. Ready for millions of users.

**Q: "What about privacy?"**
> A: We anonymize leaderboard entries, allow opt-outs, and are GDPR-compliant. Students control their visibility.

**Q: "How do you measure success?"**
> A: We track engagement (DAU, session length), learning (quiz improvements), and motivation (XP progression, streaks). A/B testing built in.
