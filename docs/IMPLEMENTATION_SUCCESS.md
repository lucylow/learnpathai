## ✨ What's Been Built

### 1. "Why This?" Explainability Card ✅
**Status:** Complete and tested

**What it does:** Every resource recommendation comes with a clear explanation showing reasoning, evidence from quiz attempts, citations, and confidence scores.

**Files created:**
- Backend: `ai-service/explainer_service.py`
- Frontend: `src/components/explainability/WhyThisCard.tsx`
- API: `POST /explain/why_this`

**Demo ready:** Yes - Click "Run Demo" in the Why This? tab

---

### 2. Evidence Panel & Provenance Tracking ✅
**Status:** Complete and tested

**What it does:** Complete audit trail for every AI decision with 4-step provenance chain, xAPI events, quality metrics, and exportable reports.

**Files created:**
- Backend: `ai-service/evidence_tracker.py`
- Frontend: `src/components/explainability/EvidencePanel.tsx`
- APIs: `POST /evidence/panel`, `POST /evidence/audit_report`

**Demo ready:** Yes - Click "Run Demo" in the Evidence Panel tab

---

### 3. Animated Path Recalculation ✅
**Status:** Complete and tested

**What it does:** Google Maps-style "recalculating route" animation when learners struggle, showing real-time path adaptation with visual impact metrics.

**Files created:**
- Frontend: `src/components/explainability/PathRecalculationAnimation.tsx`
- Uses Framer Motion for smooth animations

**Demo ready:** Yes - Click "Simulate Failure" in the Path Recalculation tab

---

### 4. Knowledge Tracing Model Ensemble ✅
**Status:** Complete and tested

**What it does:** Toggle between Beta (explainable), DKT (accurate), and Ensemble (balanced) models with side-by-side comparison of strengths and limitations.

**Files created:**
- Frontend: `src/components/explainability/KTModelToggle.tsx`
- Backend: Updated `ai-service/app.py` with `POST /predict_mastery/ensemble`

**Demo ready:** Yes - Click "Run Demo" in the Model Ensemble tab
