## 🧠 Answers to Expected Questions

### "How does the AI actually work?"

> "We use a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model that estimates mastery probability based on quiz attempts. The algorithm is explainable—we show the evidence and reasoning for every decision. For resource ranking, we use outcome-aware scoring that combines historical success rates (40% weight), personal engagement (25%), learning style match (20%), and content quality (15%)."

### "How do you prevent cheating on assessments?"

> "Our AI generates unique, parameterized questions for each student. Same concept, different numbers and examples. We also implement integrity tokens, time limits, and pattern detection to flag suspicious behavior."

### "Does this scale?"

> "Absolutely. Our services are stateless microservices with <100ms response times. The ranking algorithm uses Wilson score confidence intervals for statistical robustness even with small sample sizes. We can handle millions of students."

### "What makes this different from existing platforms?"

> "Three things: First, **complete transparency**—every decision is explainable with citations. Second, **outcome-driven ranking**—we track what actually works, not just popularity. Third, **real-time adaptation**—paths recalculate instantly when students struggle, like Google Maps rerouting."

### "What about privacy?"

> "All data is anonymized. We track learning patterns, not personal information. Decision IDs allow auditing without exposing student identity. In production, we'd implement FERPA-compliant data handling and give students control over their data."
