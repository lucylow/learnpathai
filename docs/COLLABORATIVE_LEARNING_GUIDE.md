## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Socket.IO Connection Issues

**Problem**: `Socket not connected` errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify backend is running on correct port
2. Check CORS settings in `collaboration.js`
3. Try `http://localhost` instead of `http://127.0.0.1`
4. Check browser console for connection errors

### AI Service Not Responding

**Problem**: Quiz generation fails

**Solutions**:
1. Verify AI service is running: `http://localhost:8001/docs`
2. Check backend can reach AI service: `curl http://localhost:8001/health`
3. Review Python logs for errors

### Collaborative Editor Not Syncing

**Problem**: Changes don't appear in other browsers

**Solutions**:
1. Check Socket.IO connection status (green badge)
2. Verify both users are in the same room
3. Look for `code_update` events in browser console

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Socket.IO Port
Edit `backend/index.js` and frontend `.env`:
```js
// backend/index.js
httpServer.listen(3002, ...);

// .env
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

### Add More AI Actions
Edit `ai-service/collaboration_service.py`:
```python
def custom_action(request):
    # Your logic here
    return response

# Add route
@app.post("/custom_action")
async def api_custom_action(request):
    return custom_action(request)
```

### Customize Roles
Edit `backend/sockets/collaboration.js`:
```js
const customRoles = ['Leader', 'Coder', 'Tester', 'Designer'];
```
