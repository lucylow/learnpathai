## 💡 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Beta Knowledge Tracing
```python
mastery = (successes + α) / (trials + α + β)
```
- Bayesian inference for mastery estimation
- Handles cold-start with priors

### 2. Wilson Score Confidence Interval
```javascript
score = (p + z²/2n - z√[p(1-p)/n + z²/4n²]) / (1 + z²/n)
```
- Statistical rigor for small samples
- 95% confidence intervals

### 3. Cosine Similarity
```javascript
similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
```
- Learning style matching
- Multi-dimensional comparison

### 4. Weighted Scoring
```javascript
score = (success × 0.40) + (engagement × 0.25) + 
        (style × 0.20) + (quality × 0.15)
```
- Multi-factor resource ranking
- Configurable weights
